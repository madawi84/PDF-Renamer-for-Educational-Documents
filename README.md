# PDF-Renamer-for-Educational-Documents
This script is to rename PDF files within a selected directory. It's specifically tailored for educational settings where each PDF document contains a unique 10-digit student ID. The script extracts this ID from the text of the PDF and uses it as the new filename, ensuring a standardized and easily searchable file naming convention.
